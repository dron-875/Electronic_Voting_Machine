# Electronic_Voting_Machine

This project involves designing an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Verilog, implemented on an FPGA Altera DE2 board. The system counts votes for four parties, updates counters on button presses, and displays results on 7-segment displays. It includes logic for vote counting, total vote calculation, and 7-segment display drivers. The design is simulated, synthesized, and tested on the FPGA to ensure proper functionality.
